"""fomoapi.io — the fomo half of the pipeline over plain HTTP, instead of through a browser.

For months the only way to read fomo from a server was to keep a signed-in Chrome running on it:
Cloudflare refuses direct calls, so an extension made the requests inside a real page and posted
the results back. It worked, and it cost a Xvfb display, a VNC server, a packed extension with its
own signing key, and a login that had to be done by hand through a remote desktop.

On 2026-09-10 fomo restricted that account. Not for anything clever — the collector was pulling
three leaderboards and two dozen wallet lookups every thirty minutes, which is what a scraper looks
like from the other side. This is the route that does not depend on one account staying in favour.

Two things make it cheap enough to matter:

  · the leaderboard costs one credit and already carries each trader's verified Solana and EVM
    wallets, so the ten-credit resolution endpoint is never needed. Checked against wallets this
    project had inferred independently: four of four exact, and the ones it adds have no fills on
    Robinhood Chain at all, which matches what the tape says about them.
  · one thesis page returns fifty recent notes across every token on the chain, so theses stop
    being a per-token cost.

What it does NOT replace is the tape. Their swap endpoint is a window on the last hundred fills per
trader with no way past it, documented as such. Ours is 109,669 fills and counting, read from the
chain for nothing. The two are not competing.
