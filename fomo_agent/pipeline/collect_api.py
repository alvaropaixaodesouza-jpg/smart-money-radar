"""One collection pass over fomoapi.io. Replaces the browser for the fomo half of the pipeline.

Same tables, same downstream, different road. What arrives here that never arrived through the
browser is the **verified wallet**: fomo's own API only ever returned an internal account with no
on-chain history, so this project inferred the trading wallet by intersecting who traded the same
token in the same minute. That inference is good — checked against these verified answers, four of
four exact — but it needed a dozen swap lookups per trader and it could not resolve a wallet that
trades quietly.

The wallets that arrive verified are linked directly. Where one contradicts a wallet we inferred,
nothing is overwritten: the conflict is recorded, because two claims on the same trader is a thing
to look at rather than a thing to resolve by whichever source spoke last.

Budget is the constraint that shapes the schedule. A free key is 1,000 credits a month, which is
32 a day, and the two calls are not worth the same: the first live pass bought 18 new traders and
125 verified wallets for 2 credits, and 16 notes for 5. So the 24h board runs every two hours
(12 a day), and the 7d board and one page of notes every eight (18 a day) — 30 a day, 900 a month,
with the guard below as the backstop rather than the plan.
